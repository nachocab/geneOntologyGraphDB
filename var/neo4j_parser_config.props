#===Memory mapped I/O settings===

#Each file in the Neo store can use memory mapped I/O for reading/writing.
#Best performance is achived if the full file can be memory mapped but if
#there isn't enough memory for that Neo will try and make the best use of
#the memory it gets (regions of the file that get accessed often will more
#likley be memory mapped).

#For high traversal speed it is important to have the nodestore.db and
#relationshipstore.db files.
